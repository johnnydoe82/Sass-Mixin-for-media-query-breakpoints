Sass (SCSS) mixin for easy media query breakpoint managing

The mixin I currently use for breakpoints. Breakpoints are defined in PXs, because it's easier to read for humans. But they are converted to EMs, because they provide more consistency between different browsers. ( See this study: http://zellwk.com/blog/media-query-units/)
